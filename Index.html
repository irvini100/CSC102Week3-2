Title:  Galaxy Casino
Scene:  One night, there was a guy and a girl in a casino building..  They were the only people there.
The girl saw a table that had a green cloth cover on it with a computer sitting on it.  She told the guy to to look and follow her to it.
As they got to the computer the guy turned it on and saw it was a casino game called "Galaxy Casino".
So, they took turns playing it and couldn't stop playing it.  It was like they were in another galaxy and was there for hours playing the game.-->
